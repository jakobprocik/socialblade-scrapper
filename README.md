# Social-Blade-Python Web Scraper

###### This small Scrapper Include the Twitch, Twitter, Youtube parts of Social Blade. 

## Why this Scrapper
As an Engineering Student who fall in love with Science and Math I was really interested in doing some calculations with the Subscriber and Video Counts of my favorite Bands.  Sure I could build a scrapper with the Youtube API, but then I had to run it every day for like 15 days to get some data for basic mathematical use. So I get the Idea to turn this into a small project. 


## Requirements
•    Requests
•    Beautifulsoup4

## Target scenarios
If you want to get some data right away from your favorite Twitch, Youtube or Twitter for like mathematical use. I was really interested in prediction of the Youtube Subscriber Counts, sure socialblade do their own prediction on their website, but I wanted to do my own. So I used my own Script to get the data and compared for example the Growth of the Band BlackPink after their Song BLACKPINK - 'Kill This Love' M/V.

## Problems I encountered while coding
The basic operations of these Functions are basically the same, but for every Sector e.g. Youtube and Twitch there was always another like name for the div Container where the Data was stored. On top of that, there are some changes between Monthly and a few DIV Containers. But I already had some skills in JS, CSS, and HTML so I could handle that very well.

## Some Additional Info
The functions only require the link to the socialblade website as a String. The return of these functions is always the data you need as a list.
